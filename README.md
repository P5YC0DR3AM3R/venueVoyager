## Below is a short description:

### What was your motivation?
We were motivated to build this stadium tracker to easily create reviews and comments of each stadium you have visited based on an authenticated users input.

### Why did you build this project?
It is a useful tool for quickly referencing your past experiences in each stadium. It is also designed to practice all of the things that we have learned in class.

### What problem does it solve?
It provides a way to create and add posts and ratings of each venue, allowing each user to access their list of venues they have and have not visited, and see a report of their experiences.

### What did you learn?
How to work in a team.  handlebars, postgresql, express-session, authenticated login
